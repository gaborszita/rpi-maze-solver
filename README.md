A raspberry pi maze solver

To clone in repositorie: git clone https://github.com/gaborszita/rpi-maze-solver

I used an Adafruit motor hat to control motors, if you use one of those install it from the Adafruit-Motor-HAT-Python-Library folder. If you use something else, it will also work but you will need to modify the code.

mazesolver1.py is the program you need to run
